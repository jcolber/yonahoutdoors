        <p>The YONAH Outdoors Name: We want to set ourselves apart from the pack and that is why we chose the name YONAH Outdoors. Mount Yonah, a small mountain located in north Georgia, stands apart from the rest of the Blue Ridge mountain range. With a 1400 foot change in elevation from the trail head to the top, the view of the Blue Ridge mountains off in the distance is spectacular. Our logo encompasses the Cherokee word “Yonah”, meaning black bear.

At YONAH Outdoors, we understand that outdoor gear can become very complex and with many parts. That’s why we are committed to simplifying the gear needed for any outdoor adventure. 
Through experience and research, we have found ways to improve upon the current design for hammock camping in both function and safety. Tying knots in a piece of rope drastically weakens the rope fibers, leaving more potential for danger. For that reason, we have ditched the rope and designed our hammock system after slings and webbing used in rock climbing equipment, which is designed to withstand large amounts of force. These issues are what motivated us to design the YONAH hammock.

Our hammock and suspension system will minimize the pieces needed and the complexity of remembering to bring everything on your adventure.

We hope you enjoy our hammock as much as we do and remember, when you need to get out and breathe beneath the trees…</p>
